# zig-os-windows

Autogenerated Zig bindings for Windows.  Goal is to be able to generate a complete set of bindings for Windows.

Currently using this MIT licensed database of the windows sdk:

## How to generate the windows zig bindings

```
cd THIS_REPO
git clone https://github.com/ohjeongwook/windows_sdk_data
zig build
./zig-cache/bin/codegen
```

This will generate the bindings in the "out" directory.  The file `out/windows.zig` is the main package file.  It will contain pub imports to all sub modules in the "windows" directory.  It will also contain a special pub symbol `everything` that provides direct access all symbols in the windows SDK through a single namespace.
